Installation
============

To install only the pyCrust module, and not the example scripts:: 

    pip install pycrust

**How to install with example scripts**

To access the example scripts, you must download the entire pyCrust
repository on GitHub. The easiest way to do this is by cloning the repo::

    git clone https://github.com/MarkWieczorek/pycrust.git
    cd pycrust
    pip install .

To execute a script::

    cd examples
    python pyCrust_Moon.py

.. note::
    Depending on how your system is set up, it might be necessary to use
    explicitly ``python3`` and ``pip3`` instead of ``python`` and ``pip`` in
    the above commands.
