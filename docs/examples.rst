Examples
========

The following example scripts can be found in the directory `examples`

``pyCrust_Moon``

A script that demonstrates how to calculate thethickenss of the lunar crust using either a constant or variable density crust. The latter can be used to reproduce the results presented in *Wieczorek et al.* (2013).

``pyCrust_Mars``

A script that demonstrates how to calculate the thickenss of the Martian crust using either a constant or variable density crust. For the variable density crust, the density is assumed to change discontinuously across the dichotomy boundary.

``Mars_crust_thick_test``

Create a crustal thickness map of Mars from gravity and topography and compare how results change if hydrostatic interfaces are not taken into account.

``pyCrust_Mars_InSight``

Create a crustal thickness map of Mars from gravity and topography, using the InSight crustal thickness constraint.

``pyCrust_Mars_InSight_dichotomy``

Create a crustal thickness map of Mars from gravity and topography, using the InSight crustal thickness constraint and different densities across the dichotomy boundary.

``mars_fcn``

Compute the free core nutation period of Mars.

``mars_figs``

Create images related to Mars in *Wieczorek et al.* (2019).

``mars_j2`` Compute the contribution to the gravitational J2 of Mars from hydrostatic interfaces beneath the lithosphere.

``Core-Moon``

Calculate the hydrostatic relief of the lunar core accounting for the non-hydrostatic potential that comes from the lithosphere.

``Earth_test``

Compute hydrostatic relief of Earth using PREM.

``ceres``

Calculate the hydrostatic shape of Ceres.
